We start with coarse-resolution clustering, and then re-cluster the resulting clusters by first re-calculating the nearest-neighbor graph and then clustering each cluster, with a finer resolution. For the final HLCA, we also calculate marker genes for every cluster. These will be used during manual annotation of the SCA."
