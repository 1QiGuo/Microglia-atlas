# Criteria

The quality of cells was then assessed based on two metrics: 
(1) The number of detected genes per cell; 
(2) The proportion of mitochondrial gene counts per cell. 
Specifically, cells with detected genes fewer than 200 and mitochondrial unique molecular identifier (UMI) count percentage larger than 10% were filtered out. 
The genes detected in more than 3 cells were retained.
